## Documents in PDF folder but not included on map

### Unresolved location for 1923 anti-Jewish covenant by Jacob Bauer in East Hampton CT
- [online link to Bauer documents in PDF folder](https://github.com/OnTheLine/otl-covenants/blob/main/pdf/easthampton_bauer_jacob.pdf)
- 15 Sept 1923 deed from Jacob Bauer to Leo J. Hedrick, v46 p511, Town of East Hampton CT includes an anti-Jewish restriction: “The said premises shall not be conveyed or leased to any person of the jewish race or extraction.” The “land with a bungalow” is described with these boundaries:
  - Northerly by land of grantor (Bauer) 250 feet
  - Easterly by highway and Lake Pocotopaug, 50 feet
  - Southerly by land of the grantor (Bauer) 250 feet
  - Westerly by land of the grantor (Bauer) 50 feet
- Unresolved problem: This 1923 Jacob Bauer property cannot be definitively linked to a specific land parcel on the 1927 Bauer Terrace map (or a more recent map). The best possible match *might* be lot #25 on the 1927 map, known today as parcels 12B and 13B on the current East Hampton GIS tax map, a vacant lot with the address 83 North Main St. But land records for the 1923 Bauer property are unclear after November 1925, so cannot definitively link Bauer ownership to 1927 lot #25.
- Our research team decided that we cannot reliably place it on our online map, but we archived it in this public repository so that anyone may read it, refer to it, and write about its existence.

### 1936 "American citizens" covenant for 2 Perkins Road, Woodbridge CT
- [online link to 2 Perkins Road documents in PDF folder](https://github.com/OnTheLine/otl-covenants/blob/main/pdf/woodbridge_2_perkins_rd.pdf)
- 29 July 1936 deed from Margaret L. Rusden Westcott to John E. Vance restricts sale or rental "to persons not American citizens" for individual property known today as 2 Perkins Road, Woodbridge CT
- Town property card mistakenly lists equivalent property as 4 Perkins Road, which does not exist in Town GIS map, and maps clearly show the current address is 2 Perkins Road.
- Our research team decided that this "American citizen" restriction currently is not covered by CT Public Act 21-173 and does not match our focus on racial restrictions. But archived it in this public repository so that anyone may read it, refer to it, and write about its existence.
